Product roadmap items:
- Design tests for data pipeline to ensure stable performance.
- Add config file in which all arguments/variables are defined
- Mask secrets / retrieve secrets from Azure
- Set-up cron job inside Docker container. (to simulate dynamic data retrieval with e.g. Twitter API)
- Twitter_data retrieval with Kaggle API directly. Resolve Authentication error experienced now
(as shown in _old/data_extract.py file)
- Improve performance of data pipeline. Pyspark computation time drastically increased when switching from local
machine to Docker implementation.
- Prediction component is not optimized at all. Add e.g. hyperparameter tuning and create additional features.
